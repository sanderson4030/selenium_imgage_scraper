# Selenium Imgage Scraper

Fastai Course v3 origionally had an example script to scrape images from google, but changes to google makes it unusable (images fetched are very tiny). 
This script gets around some of the issues, but with changes to privacy settings on google still pulls some ammount of undersized images. It also is not very fast due to the constraints of selenium.
